					<h1>What is Aero's Quest</h1>

					<p>Aero's Quest is a great little indie gem that brings you back to the days when 2D sidescrollers like Mario were at their best. Your quest is to save your love Ariella from an android named Andraus, who has taken her captive. you begin by traversing through levels trying to save your love Ariella from Andraus, who is trying to break the bond between you and Ariella by playing some sick game with you always disappearing with Ariella in a green puff of smoke just as you reach them. </p>

					<h1>Gameplay</h1>
					<p>The controls are simple as you would expect from a 2D sidescroller, you can move forward, backward , duck and jump. The controls are very responsive but with the odd jump not registering but this is very rare. You have the choice to play with a keyboard or gamepad both of which work great, personally I find the gamepad a lot more enjoyable but you may find the opposite to be true.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>In terms of gameplay this game is solid sometimes tense and frequently frustrating, making you want to throw your whole system out the window as you make your 50th attempt at navigating your way through each level trying to unlock and get to the cage Ariella is contained within by stepping on some sort of pressure plates to unlock the cage, jumping through teleporters to reach a certain section of the level and/or solving some combinations that is given to you at the beginning of the level but is usually forgotten due to focusing on actually getting there in one piece before the timer runs out, all the while avoiding spike pits, machines with saws on top, lava, different types of projectiles etc. </p>

				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p>There are also some power-ups in some levels to help you along the way, these power ups look like orbs just a little smaller than your character each with their own individual colour so you can tell them apart. Red is the points power up it is not really a power up but really just gives you more points for that level as far as I remember this power up is the only one that is placed on every level, Green is the speed power up which allows you to move faster for 10 seconds, Purple is a power jump which allows you to jump higher for 10 seconds, Blue is the stealth power up which basically makes you invincible for 10 seconds, Amber is the time warp power up which permanently slows down time (for that level until death/completion) and everything else in the game apart from you and as far as I can tell moving platforms stay the same speed, this power up also applies a vintage kind of overlay which looks cool but can be a bit too dark around the edges.</p>

					<p>The only real flaw I found with gameplay is certain obstacles you must overcome seem more about getting lucky rather than skill, this has to do with some of the placements of multiple projectiles firing in different directions, while most of the time when you come across these types of obstacles it is fine but on a few levels the projectile placement seems more like bad design.</p>

					<h1>Graphics and Sound</h1>
					<p>The art style is nice but not great, the background looks hand crafted which is probably the best looking part of the game, everything else looks kind of boring including the enemies and player, then there is screen clutter that can consist of leaves and vines or rocks and fire etc. (depending on what stage you are on) these look cool at first but then become quickly annoying constantly obscuring traps and pressure plates. The sound isn't bad I suppose the music is not great but it won't annoy you, the character death sound effect (loud scream) is funny at first but soon becomes irritating, just a simple splatter sound would have done fine and would have been less annoying but I suppose that's what the mute button is for.</p>

					<h1>Overall</h1>
					<p>Despite my criticism about the graphics and sound this truly is a fun game and challenging as a platformer/puzzle type game should be, you have got to be fast to beat the timer yet careful enough not to end up exploding in a pile of blood and guts all over the screen and map. Aero's Quest is the kind of game that will suck you in for hours on end but have you raging the whole time, honestly if you have a tenancy to break things while doing badly in a game, well then Aero's Quest is not for you then because by the time you are finished with the game there will be nothing left to break. Even though some levels will drive you crazy, there is something about the game that will keep pulling you back in, calling you to just complete that one hard level you have already failed 20 or 30 times before hand. This is how games of Aero's Quest type should make you feel they are suppose to make things so challenging that you end up filled with pure anger but love the game too much to quit even when the time to quit has long passed.</p>

					<p>While Aero's Quest has some issues like obscuring traps for example, overall this is a great game, definitely recommended to anyone with a good temperament (really the rage you may feel is not exaggerated) and anyone who maybe interested in a game like this. So all things considered I give this game a 7 out of 10, its a great game but it is not without its flaws.</p>
