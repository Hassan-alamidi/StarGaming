					<h1></h1>
					<p>Fallout 4 the game we have all been waiting for got its full reveal on Sunday June 14th at Bethesda's E3 press conference. For years we have all been crying out to Bethesda for a new Fallout game and apparently the people over at Bethesda have been silently giggling at our suffering as they knew the longer we were kept waiting the more surprised and excited we would be about the announcements that would unfold during their E3 press conference. According to Bethesda this game has been in the works since just after Fallout 3 was released in 2008, so around early 2009 and they only really started to focus on the game about 4 years ago. They have kept this a secret since 2009, it has got to be said Bethesda have done an amazing job keeping a game like this under-wraps for so long, I would say the temptation to release or leak information early nearly killed the staff. Thankfully though they were able to contain themselves and it seems all that waiting in silence was worth it.</p>

					<h1>The Plot</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p>Fallout 4 starts in pre-war times with you and your wife or husband (depending on you characters gender) looking in the mirror making small talk unaware of what is soon to become of the world they live in, this is where you will begin sculpting your characters appearance. When you are finished with the character creation you leave the bathroom where you are then immediately greeted by a Mr.Handy called Codsworth, who has already brewed you a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
				</div>

		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p> After some exploration around your players house someone rings your doorbell, when you open the door you are greeted by a shady-looking door salesman from Vault-Tec if you choose the option to be reminded what vault-tec's services are, the salesman will then proceed by giving you a cheesy sales pitch and if you accept you are brought straight to the all familiar S.P.E.C.I.A.L menu. After a quick cut in the E3 demo you hear a baby crying and Codsworth calls you by name (yes the one you typed in not some sort of nickname like other games according to Todd Howard more than 1000 of the most popular names have been recorded for Codsworth to say) explaining he cannot calm the baby down, once you check up on the baby he quickly clams down as you play with him.The relaxing tone of the game quickly changes as Codsworth anxiously begins to call you and your partner to the living room claiming there is something you should see. As you leave the room you begin to hear someone (I assume the president) talking on the T.V about confirmed reports of nuclear detonations in New York and Pennsylvania, you then begin to hear Air-Raid sirens break out as the president struggles to stay strong for his country all of a sudden the T.V turns to a "PLEASE STAND BY" Screen.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p> Your character quickly realises that if Boston was to be hit as well it would mean the end, so you and your family have got to move fast to the vault to ensure you and your family's survival. As you begin your endeavour to the vault you see the military down the road from your house and people with the same idea as you, getting to the vault before its too late. As you make it to the platform on top of the vault you tell your wife you love her, she returns the gesture and suddenly a nuclear explosion occurs as you then begin to be lowered into the vault before it is too late. The clip ends just before you get lowered into the vault as Todd Howard explains that they are not going to be spoiling or talking about the games story but you do survive and emerge 200 years later as the sole survivor of vault 111, at this point we can only assume the players body and cells are preserved through cryogenic preservation.</p>

		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<h1>Character creation</h1>
					<p>The character creation system looks like it could be very interesting allowing players to create their perfect character, according to Todd Howard the system used to create your character is supposedly the same system used to create NPCs and if that is true which I am sure it is, we could be given the tools to be very creative with our character to sculpt him/her to perfection. With most games character creation can be a bit of a hit and miss, while it is always nice to create your own character a lot of the time the pre-sets look very similar and you end up with a deformed version of the guy/girl you started out with, but by looking at the character they created and the pre-sets in the game it seems like you can create a character vastly different from the first pre-set.</p>
					<br/>
					<p> Bethesda have even gone so far as to generate a baby based on the couple you create, which leads me to believe you are not actually the "lone survivor of vault 111" or maybe you can have a baby with someone else. I say this because it seems like a lot of effort for a baby you are only going to see for no more than a few minutes. I am leaning towards the not really a "lone survivor of vault 111" theory as fallout games tend to give you a track someone down mission as your very first real quest. In Fallout 3 it was your father and Fallout New Vegas it was Benny, this time I suspect it is to track down your wife and child. This is all just speculation though and very unlikely as there would be a lot of holes to be filled in for that kind of a story, so they might unfortunately just have died in the vault with everybody else.</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Animations and Player/NPC Interactions</h1>
					<br/>
					<p>In previous Bethesda games the player and NPC animations have been rather stiff, Skyrim had good animations apart from in conversation where again NPCs were like wooden planks rarely moving unless they were already doing something before you started the conversation like sharpening an axe but in fallout 4 that seems to have all changed, animations seem to have been greatly improved, looking more fluid and natural I don't just mean in conversations either. </p>

				<img src="../../images/deathclaw.jpg" class="imgcon" alt="Fallout 4 deathclaw" />
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p>Starting with combat the one most players would be interested in, in combat Deathclaws grab you for what I assume is its killing blow, a new enemy called the Bloodbug latches its self onto you to suck your blood, super-mutants actually look like they are striking you with their super sledge, the dog you come across to join you in your quests appears to latch on with its teeth and drags enemy's to the ground and you actually look like you are doing real damage to an enemy when melee attacking them.</p>
					<p>Guns appear to have actual recoil rather than the previous disorientating screen shake that was in fallout new Vegas, making the guns appear more powerful.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
				<p>Interaction with friendly NPCs look great too from the quick peek we got of it, conversation looks genuine with body Language, hands, head and facial gestures make it look like you are having a conversation with someone with real personality rather than just some empty good looking character. Unlike previous Fallout games your character is voiced and the voice actors seem good and do not appear as if they will become too annoying during a second or third playthrough of the game. Conversations are supposedly as dynamic as the rest of the game according to Todd Howard "you can walk away if you want or shoot them in the face if you want", sounds like a great addition to me, sometimes shooting NPCs in the face sounds a hell of a lot better than being locked a conversation in until you have exhausted all options and you are finally given the option to say goodbye.</p>

					<h1>Weapons and armour</h1>
					<p>As previously stated from the combat clip shown at E3 guns appear to have genuine weapon recoil rather than the screen shake used in previous fallout games and as a result of this the weapons when fired look more realistic and powerful. Melee weapons appear to really knock back opponents as if they were really with a bat or the butt of a gun. The guns look a little low texture and very clean considering they were found in the wasteland but that's nothing a weapon re-texture pack cant fix.</p>
				
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p> Guns also appear to be affected by heat this was only really noticeable on the Gatling gun during the E3 press conference, but as the user shot the Gatling gun more the barrels would begin to glow red from the heat as of now we do not know if this is only pure cosmetic or whether it can actually impact the guns performance for example causing it to jam, increased weapon degradation or reduced efficiency and accuracy. This could be a very cool addition to fallout making combat more complex and intense while also adding realism.</p>

		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
				<p>Armour is now a layered system meaning you can find and put on not just a whole vest or pants but rather things like shoulder pads, boots, gloves, chest pieces by the looks of it you can still find the one for all armour sets but the option is also their if you want to mix and match for individual body parts.</p>
				<br/>
				<h1>Crafting system</h1>
				<br/>
				<p>There has been some interesting changes/improvements to the crafting system so to start out there are more than 50 weapons in the base game to find in the world but and this is a big but most weapons can be modified into something completely different for example with the right components you can turn a Laser Pistol into a Laser Rifle. While 50 weapons sounds like a small amount of weapons, there are over 700 modifications for those weapons, so less weapons to find in the world but more weapons in general than previous fallout games. This is a bit of a hit and miss for me as I do love adding scopes and silencers to my weapons in fallout and crafting old weapons into completely new ones sounds great, I love finding them in the world much more though. Again though a few weapon packs from mod creators will fix that, since consoles will also be able to use mods in fallout 4 nobody else will really notice either unless the person refuses to use them that is. Another little cool addition is the ability to modify your own power armour in much the same way. Remember in previous fallout games there was a lot of clutter some that you could actually pick up but was completely useless junk weighing you down well that's no more in fallout 4 as every item that can be picked up can be used for something, for example maybe you need a few screws for what ever you are building well you can find those in toy cars, need a glass salvage it from a microscope or maybe you just need steel well you can salvage that from items like a kettle. This to me is a great addition bethesda love to fill their worlds up with tons of items and in fallout some of these items were useless or such little use that you had no idea they could be used at all and when you realised you needed one by the time you found that item again you pass by it like it was junk because you have completely forgotten.</p>

				<img src="../../images/settlement.jpg" class="imgcon" alt="building settlements in fallout 4" />
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p>A completely new concept has been added into fallout 4 which is the ability to construct shelters and build settlements. You start off by scrapping items in the world to use for materials and begin building your shelter, beds, chairs etc. As your settlement grows you begin attracting people including traders that have one of the best items in the game. To keep these people you will need to plant food, set up a water pump and even place down a power generator. Power generators seem pretty cool (well the items you can power not the generator) you use switches and wires to link to anything that needs power, at this moment we do not know if the generators will require fuel or just run off the magic of imagination.</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row maincontainer">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="txtpara txtmain">
					<p>You can power many things like turrets, lights and even terminals to control them, it will be very interesting to see what the modding community will do with a system like this. You may have notices I mentioned you can power turrets, you maybe thinking to your self well what's the point, well similar to Skyrim's Hearthfire DLC where you could build your own house and from time to time your house could get raided, the same applies here bandits will come and raid your settlement so you need to be prepared to keep your people and loot safe. Todd Howard states this is an optional part of the game, I personally hope you can still purchases or earn homes just in case this system is not to my liking it sounds good in theory but whether it is good or not might not be that easy to answer and may take some experimenting to make any real judgement.</p>

				<h1>Pip boy and the Hood</h1>
				<p>The pip-boy is pretty much the same as New Vegas with some buttons moved around and a few new features like the ability to view holotapes and play games. The in game hood is not to my taste it looks to be a little intrusive but looking at the clips sometimes the hood is there sometimes it is not so it may actually dynamically hide itself until needed, lets just hope it is.</p>

				<h1>The Game world</h1>
				<p>Fallouts game world is arguably the best part of Fallout with massive wastelands for you to explore and scavenge, unfortunately we do not know much about the Fallout 4 world other than it is set in Boston and looks great. With games like Fallout to really judge the world you need to experience it yourself, the world maps in fallout are way too big to make too much judgement on a few clips so we are just going to have to wait and see what it is really like.</p>

					<h1>Over All Thoughts</h1>
					<p>There have been a lot of complaining about things like game graphics and having a voiced player character, as a fan of fallout I am not too sure about voiced characters either, but while I cannot speak for you, Bethesda have yet to disappoint me with any of their games and I doubt they will this time either. Some game companies release the same S*** every year and milk that cash cow long after it is dry but it is clear to see Bethesda have really tried to improve upon their previous titles with this game. Bethesda already have the whole open world RPG thing perfected so it is only natural that focusing on story would be the next step, the way I see it is, have you ever felt bad for killing someone that did not deserve to be killed in fallout 3 or new Vegas, for me personally 9 times out of 10 no, I have never really felt a connection to any character in the fallout series and this is the only area fallout has never really done well in and you can really see that Bethesda realise this and are trying to improve it the best they can. With the addition of a voiced character for you to feel a connection towards, you also have better NPC interaction with NPCs that feel a little more real so you can have some sort of feelings towards them whether it be love or hate. I know it is a big change in the franchise but it might work better than you would expect. As far as graphics go I think the game looks great it may not look as good as some other newly released games but that to me does not matter because fallout has never been about graphics, for that reason and the fact so many people are upset about the graphics I decided not give graphics much more attention than I have here. So getting back on subject this game looks great, there are parts of the game that may or may not work but overall it seems like this game is going to have us happily waste our lives away in front of a screen. Lucky for us we won't have to wait long either as the game is set to release on November 10 this year.</p>
